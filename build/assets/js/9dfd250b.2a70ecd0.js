So, the story of Superflows, is essentially my story. I am a software engineer and have been working in the software industry for around 13 years now. After graduating from Georgia Tech, Atlanta, USA, I co-founded a software consulting company. We specialized in developing highly scalable cloud-based software applications. The company was largely bootstrapped and I grew the company from 2 employees to 25 employees. I always enjoyed the engineering aspect of my work. I love architecting, designing, problem solving, writing code & refactoring systems. As the consulting business was growing, I realized that I was spending more time on the business side than pursuing what I loved. After 10 years as the CEO, I finally decided to step down, take an exit and focus my energies full-time on something, where I found meaning.
