Moving on, by any teeny tiny chance, have you ever had the good fortune of watching two performances of the same amazing play twice? Yes? Then what was the one thing that struck you? I\u2019ll tell you what struck me the most. I once saw two back to back performances of a play within a span of hours. The day, the cast and the venue was the same. The only variable was the audience. What struck me most, was that both the performances or if I may call them renditions, felt so different! The scenes were same, characters were the same, dialogues didn\u2019t change at all, still, I experienced the difference. If you allow me some liberty to get a little philosophical, I would say, such is life! Right?

When the daring Sheikh from UAE challenged his team to build the greatest hotel ever built, the first problem they had to solve was creating an artificial island that would withstand the tremendous pressure from the sea waves and at the same time serve as the foundation of a 300 meter tall structure. Then there was also this not so little problem about the wind. The shape of this structure was that of a sail; just imagine the amount of wind a 300 meter tall sail would have to withstand! Needless to say, with such a humungous ask at hand, the team had to start somewhere. The engineers began their work. First they figured out how to build the island that met the brief. They created a rock-bed and then topped it up with a mesh of perforated concrete blocks. This artificial sponge prevented flooding and absorbed the pressure of waves. Then they addressed the problem of the structure stability.

Moreover, the track had to be near flat and a minimum radial curvature of 1.25 Km had to be maintained to enable faster train speeds. After commissioning, the engineers began their work and completed it in record time! They ended up creating one of the most scenic train routes in the world comprising of 2000 plus bridges and 91 tunnels!
