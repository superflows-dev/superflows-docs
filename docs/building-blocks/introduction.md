# Introduction

Building blocks are the most basic components from an application design point of view. Imagine your application as a tree of functionalities, then these building blocks would become the leaf nodes. You can also think of your application functionality, as being made up of inter-connected lego blocks, these building blocks would then become the simplest of the lego parts.

Each building block:
- Has a defined function
- Is reusable
- Is customizable
