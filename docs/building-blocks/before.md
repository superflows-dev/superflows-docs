# Before You Begin

For working with the building blocks, react-sf-themes supermod is a pre-requisite. Install it, if you haven't already.

```bash
npm install --save react-sf-themes
```

We also use icons from time to time. You can install the Bootstrap icons package. Any other icon package of your choice can also be used.

```bash
npm install --save react-bootstrap-icons
```
