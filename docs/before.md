# Pre-requisites

Before getting started with Superflows, following are the pre-requisites:

- **Familiarity with Web Development** - You need to be familiar with the basic concepts of HTML, CSS  & Javscript. You need not be an expert developer, but basic knowledge is necessary. [W3 Schools Roadmap](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/) could be a good starting point for this.
- **Admin access to an AWS account** - Most supermods need AWS backends, so you will need admin access to at least one AWS account. If you don't have access, you can easily [create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) of your own, it is free.
