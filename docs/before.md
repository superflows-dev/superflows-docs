# Pre-requisites

Before getting started with Superflows, following are the pre-requisites:

- **Familiarity with React** - You need to be familiar with the basic concepts of React. You need not be an expert developer, but basic knowledge is necessary. [The Official React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) could be a good starting point for this.
- **Admin access to an AWS account** - Most supermods need AWS backends, so you will need admin access to at least one AWS account. If you don't have access, you can easily [create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) of your own, it is free.
