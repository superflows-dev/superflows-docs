## About Superflows

### About Me

This project is conceived, designed, developed and maintained by me, [Hrushi M](https://twitter.com/hrushi?lang=en). So, the story of Superflows, is essentially my story. I am a software engineer and have been working in the software industry for around 13 years now. After graduating from Georgia Tech, Atlanta, USA, I co-founded a software consulting company. We specialized in developing highly scalable cloud-based software applications. The company was largely bootstrapped and I grew the company from 2 employees to 25 employees. I always enjoyed the engineering aspect of my work. I love architecting, designing, problem solving, writing code & refactoring systems. As the consulting business was growing, I realized that I was spending more time on the business side than pursuing what I loved. After 10 years as the CEO, I finally decided to step down, take an exit and focus my energies full-time on something, where I found meaning. Thus began Superflows!

### Opportunity

In my 10 years of software consulting, I worked on several applications using a variety of architectures. The serverless backends sort of evolved during the same time window. I have always been intrigued by their disruptive potential. During the later half of my consulting career, I did a lot of projects that utilized serverless technologies such as DynamoDB from AWS and Firestore from Google cloud. I got great results!

### Concept

Serverless technologies have considerably matured in the last decade, opening new doors for technology innovations. Superflows is conceived as an application development framework for cloud-based applications using serverless technologies. I believe that Superflows will enable more developers to build better, good quality and scalable cloud-native applications.

### Features

- **Reusable** - Superflows is a collection of reusable serverless components
- **Customizable** - Customizability is built in. You can change the appearance or look & feel of all the components by overriding the base css properties.
- **Serverless** - Superflows components are designed using the AWS serverless backend technologies. Additionally, the React code directly integrates with the AWS SDK for all backend features, hence backend coding knowledge is not required. Any frontend developer, with just React know-how, can build full-featured applications.

### Superflows Component System

Superflows is not a single library. It is designed as a collection of reusable components and their respective libraries. Every component has a defined purpose & function and can be thought of as a single plug and play unit. By integrating these components together, you can build a good quality complex web application, pretty quickly.

### Project Status

Superflows is in its early days, in fact, still in the first quarter of its inception! The concept has been reasonably crystallized. Few initial modules have already been developed and published as evident from the documentation. I will keep updating this section as the project journeys ahead.

### Team Superflows

Currently, Superflows is a one-person-driving-everything project. I plan to keep it the same way for the next few months until   the basics are in place. If you wish to get in touch, use <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1018780901334863873/1018780901334863876">discord</a>.
